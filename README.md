# Native-tdm :ocean:
## Product Vision:

Native TDM is a fully native, performant and minimal **personal** task manager and productivity application which aims to provide users with **regular feedback/statistics on their time management habits** so they can continuously optimize and achieve improved productivity. 

## What Native-TDM aims to solve: 

* Made specifically for personal productivity management.  
> Most project management tools are commercial and focused on larger teams, Native-TDM is built with a single user in mind to manage personal productivity. This means that Native-TDM is tailored to your personal needs. 

* Follows minimalistic design principles. 
> Only features you'll need. No uneccessarily complex functionality. 

* Fully open-source and extendable codebase. 
> Non-commercial, open-source application. Freely change according to your needs.

This README is still under work in progress and will likely be changed to include more detail in the near future.
